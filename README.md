# SuperStore-Anlaysis using Power BI <br />
## Introduction
A Microsoft Power BI project that analyses the data of Superstore Sales Data from 2011 to 2014 using visualizations such as bar charts, doughnut charts, cards, slicers, line and area charts, etc. <br />
The data we have is Superstore sales data across the world from 2011 to 2014. It has 3 tables named ‘Orders’, ‘People’, and ‘Returns’. We will focus on the ‘Orders’ table which consists of around 51 thousand rows and 21 columns.
I have visualized the top 5 products which are getting sold highly according to profit, sales and quantity.
## Data
I have analyzed the sales, profits, and quantities sold by the store in different regions by different shipment modes and in different segments.
## Analysis
Also, I have analyzed what are the sub-categories of the products being sold the most, the trend of the sales and profits every month over the years.
